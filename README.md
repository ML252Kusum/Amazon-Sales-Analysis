This project aims to analyze and predict Amazon Sales using comprehensive dataset.The analysis includes data preprocessing,exploratory data analysis(EDA),feature engineering and the development of predictive model.
The project designed to provide insights into sales trends,shipping duration,profit margins,and other key metrices.
The main objective of this project is to analyze Amazon Sales data to uncover meaningful insights for future sales.The specific goals includes:

1. Identifying sales trends(monthly,yearly,and year-month wise).
2. Analyzing Profit margins across different regions and product categories.
3. Evaluting shipping Durations based on sales channels and order priorities.
4. Developing Predictive models to forecast Future Sales.

The dataset includes the following columns:

- Region: The region where the sale happened.
- Country: The country of the sale.
- Item Type: The type of item sold.
- Sales Channel: The channel used for the sale (e.g., online, offline).
- Order Priority: The priority level of the order.
- Order Date: The date the order was placed.
- Order ID: A unique identifier for each order.
- Ship Date: The date the order was shipped.
- Units Sold: The number of units sold.
- Unit Price: The price per unit.
- Unit Cost: The cost per unit.
- Total Revenue: The total revenue from the sale.
- Total Cost: The total cost of the sale
- Total Profit: The total profit from the sale.

- ## Analysis

### Sales Trends

- Monthly Trends: View sales patterns by month.
- Yearly Trends: Observe sales changes year over year.
- Year-Month Trends*: Combine year and month for detailed trends.

### Key Metrics

- Profit Margins: Analyze profit margins across various categories.
- Shipping Duration: Examine shipping times based on order and ship dates, sorted by order priority and sales channel.
- Sales Channel Performance: Compare sales performance across different channels.

- ## Predictive Modeling

Built models to predict future sales using:
 Linear Regression

### Steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Future Sales Prediction

## Results and Insights

- Sales Trends: Seasonal patterns and year-over-year growth.
- Shipping Analysis: Certain priorities and channels have faster shipping.
- Profit Margins: Specific item types and regions contribute more to profit.
